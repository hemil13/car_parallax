        <h3 style="width:450px; text-align: left;">porsche 901 concept (1963-1973)</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
            -- The 901 concept of 1963 heralded the start of a production run even Porsche probably didn’t expect to reach – and no 
            doubt surpass – six decades. Trivia fans can rejoice at the fact the <b style="color: goldenrod;">name changed form 901 to 911</b>
            to avoid potential fisticuffs with Peugeot.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- It was designed as a larger, more practical version of the 356 with an extra pair of seats. As such, critics were quick to 
            pounce on its lack of focus.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- Early 911s used two-litre engines with as little as 130bhp, though they also weighed bang on a tonne. 
            Both engine sizes and power outputs swelled over the next decade, culminating in perhaps the most coveted of all early 911s, 
            <b style="color: goldenrod;">the 210bhp 2.7 Carrera RS</b>.

        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
            -- Each new iteration of 911 was internally codenamed with a letter of the alphabet, but it wasn’t until reaching G that there 
            was a discernable difference in styling and tech, and the dawn of a new generation.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- The G-Series ran for a long time, too, debuting in <b style="color: goldenrod;">1973</b> and only being replaced in 
            <b style="color: goldenrod;">1989</b>. The most significant move made in this time was the introduction of turbocharging to 
            the 911, the Turbo you see above arriving in 1975 with a mighty <b style="color: goldenrod;">260bhp powering the rear wheels</b>. 
            Back then, though, turbochargers were saved for only the fastest 911s...

        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
            -- The 964, to give it its internal codename, arrived at the very end of the 1980s, bringing with it some mildly updated styling 
            but a whole heap of new tech.
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- In fact, it was 85 per cent new. Four-wheel drive arrived for the first time, as did other tech goodies like
            <b style="color: goldenrod;">power steering, ABS brakes and airbags</b>.
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- Until recently, second-hand examples of these could be picked up exceedingly cheap, its design viewed retrospectively 
            as the least attractive in 911 history. Many are now becoming donor cars for Singer products, though, while the stripped-out 964 RS 
            is spiralling in value in recognition of it being one of the focused 911 products ever.

        <h3 style="width:310px; text-align: left;">porsche 993 (1994-1998)</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
            -- We’re going to stick with Porsche’s internal model codes, both to avoid confusion and because they’re reasonably well known 
            among car nerds. The 993 arrived just <b style="color: goldenrod;">five years after the 964</b>, and is still regarded by many 
            Porsche die-hards as the prettiest and best-judged of the lot.
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- It was the last 911 with an <b style="color: goldenrod;">air-cooled engine</b>, while it also introduced perhaps the 
            lairiest car in 911 history to drive, <b style="color: goldenrod;">the GT2</b>. It’s a badge that’s continued service since, 
            of course, but the original perhaps best displayed those tail-happy tendencies brought about by the 911’s infamously unconventional 
            rear-engine layout. Small wonder it earned itself the nickname <b style="color: goldenrod;">‘Widow Maker’</b>.

        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
            --Following such a loved generation of car, the 1998 arrival of the <b style="color: goldenrod;">water-cooled</b> 996 was met
            with grumbles and cries of 'it’s lost its character', something of a running theme for new-generation 911s and the implacable 
            Porsche aficionados they’ve tried to please.
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- Those nonplussed by the change in hardware were probably upset by the looks, the 911 gaining its 
            <b style="color: goldenrod;">first major styling change</b>, not dissimilar to the cheaper Boxster and notable for its
            – <b style="color: goldenrod;">shock horror!</b> – <b style="color: goldenrod;">non-elliptical headlights</b>.
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- The 996 also marked the exponential growth in 911 variants, but when that also goes hand-in-hand with the 
            <b style="color: goldenrod;"> first ever GT3 </b>being launched, that’s far from bad news
        </p>


        <br>

        <br>

        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- Water-cooled 911s also kicked off the habit of major mid-life updates. The 996 received its big
            <b style="color: goldenrod;">facelift</b> in 2001, with attempts to appease critics of its styling, an updated interior and a 
            <B style="color: goldenrod;">new glass-roofed Targa variant</B>, though it was nothing like as stylish as its ancestors.
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- The mk2 996 also marked the arrival of <b style="color: goldenrod;">another 911 GT2</b>, and while it was a bit less hairy 
            than its Nineties namesake, it was still a <b style="color: goldenrod;">196mph</b>, 
            <b style="color: goldenrod;">turbocharged 911 without the safety of a four-wheel-drive system</b>. Senior.

        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
            -- Round headlights made a swift return in 2004, with the arrival of an all-new 911 generation. Its shape was broadly the same as 
            the 996, but its <b style="color: goldenrod;">detailing more delicate</b>. All had <b style="color: goldenrod;">more than 300bhp</b>, 
            while a <b style="color: goldenrod;">new GT2</b> entered unchartered territory with <b style="color: goldenrod;">530bhp</b>.
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- Once again, though, claims of diminishing of character greeted the 997's arrival, with purists grumbling about less 
            feelsome steering and the softening of the 911's, um, exciting edges thanks to <b style="color: goldenrod;">stronger grip</b>.

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- The looks barely changed, but there were bigger changes a foot underneath them for the updated 997. More efficient

            while the <b style="color: goldenrod;">PDK twin-clutch gearbox arrived</b>. Immediate response wasn’t rapturous, but after 
            Porsche fitted the <b style="color: goldenrod;">double-clutcher with proper paddles</b>, its appeal over the clunky old 
            Tiptronic automatic was clear.
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            -- The 911 reached its only recently unsurpassed power peak thanks to the utterly <b style="color: goldenrod;">ludicrous 611bhp GT2 RS</b>, 
            while arguably the best ever 911 – <b style="color: goldenrod;">the GT3 RS 4.0</b> – also landed in this generation, too.

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
