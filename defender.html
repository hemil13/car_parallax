        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
            -- The Defender 90 was the shortest of them all, and it draws back its moniker from the old Series II Land Rover. 
            That model featured just two doors at the front and one entry (side-hinged) in the back and could take as many people on board as 
            they could stuff inside that cramped cabin. Over the years, the Series II became the Defender in the late '80s and was allowed to 
            carry just five people on face-forward seats. That car became an icon and was cherished and loved by many despite its many 
            design flaws. With the second, entirely new generation of the Defender, Land Rover moved this model on a 
            <b style="color: goldenrod;">higher level of comfort and quality</b>, but without forgetting its agricultural roots.
        </p>
    
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            --  The car's exterior resembles the old D100 concept car that was unveiled by the British automaker in 2011. 
            In 2019, the production version of that prototype came alive and had the Defender nameplate attached to it. 
            The front fascia featured a pair of headlights adorned by circular LEDs that headlamps installed on its predecessor. 
            Still, the plastic bumper and grille were nothing like those from the previous model. But it looked bold. In addition, the 
            flared wheel arches and the overall look were unmistakably inspired by the Series II and III. The 2019 Defender 90 featured 
            two doors and a short wheelbase, just like its ancestors. The flat, vertical cut at the rear with the externally mounted spare wheel 
            was also charismatic for this model. At the back, <b style="color: goldenrod;">the taillights sported a rectangular shape</b>.
        </p>
    
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            --   Inside, it was a modern vehicle fitted with all the features and amenities of an upscale off-roader. There was a 
            <b style="color: goldenrod;">digital instrument cluster</b> instead of analog dials and a landscape-oriented touchscreen 
            for the infotainment system on top of the center. 
            Between the comfortable front seats, Land Rover installed a tall center console that housed a few storage areas and an armrest. 
            The gear selector for the automatic transmission found its place closer to the dashboard, like in the old days. 
            Bonus points: It was easier to use. In the back, the carmaker installed a flat-folding bench seat that could accommodate up to 
            three occupants, although the legroom was minimal.

            Power went in all corners via a two-speed transfer box. To better cope with off-road situations, the automaker offered an

        <h3>new defender 110</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
            -- When Rover introduced the Series 1 in 1948 as the Land Rover, it was mostly an agricultural vehicle built to take
            its owners to the field and back and work all day long. But the little rugged car evolved, and the Land Rover became a distinct 
            brand from the Rover three decades later, in 1978. It was already known as an off-road vehicle manufacturer. 
            The old Series I evolved into the Series II, and then, in 1989, these were replaced by the Defender. 
            After three unsuccessful marriages, one with Honda, the second with BMW, and the third with Ford, Land Rover ended up 
            together with its Jaguar sibling in Tata Motor Company. The new owner paid for the development of the Defender’s second generation, 
            which was launched in September 2019 at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
        </p>
    
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            --  For the new generation, Land Rover made a unibody construction for the vehicle, ditching the body-on-frame structure that 
            was previously used. The 110, which was the five-door, long-wheelbase version, shared its front fascia with the rest of the range. 
            It featured a pair of headlights adorned by circular LED daytime running lights, which resembled the older headlights used on 
            the 1989 Defender. Its plastic bumper was extended in the lower area by an underbody shield. From its sides, the flared wheel 
            arches and the flat door panels resembled those from its predecessor. Behind the rear doors, the automaker placed a wider C-pillar. 
            The flat, vertical cut at the rear with the externally mounted spare wheel was also charismatic for this model. At the back, 
            the taillights sported a rectangular shape with small LED lamps.

            In the back, passengers could share the split-folding bench seat and had enough legroom and headroom. In addition, the automaker 
            offered a jump seat between the front passengers or two folding seats in the trunk.

            a single- or a double-cab pickup bodywork. In those times, the car 
            didn't sport the Defender nameplate. That came later, and it was again offered with that long-wheelbase version. In 2022, 
            the carmaker chose a different approach for its famous SUV.

            longer floor with wider side windows and quarter panels behind the rear doors. The 1.49 m (58.7") rear overhang decreased the 
            departure angle of the SUV but offered more room inside. Moreover, even though it had plenty of space for the spare wheel, it 
            still had it on the rear door.

            room for three adults, leading to an eight-seat vehicle. Last but not least, the trunk area was more than enough. 
            It provided up to 2,516 liters (88.8 cu-ft) of space up from the 2,380 liters (84 cu-ft) available in the Defender 110. 
            Like its siblings, the SUV offered a <b style="color: goldenrod;">standard 11.4" Pivi Pro touch-screen infotainment system,
